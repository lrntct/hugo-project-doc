This template uses [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)
with [bootwatch paper theme](https://bootswatch.com/paper/)'s custom sass variables.
You can change any kind of properties such as font size, color set and etc. in `_sass/_variables.scss` file.
Don't forget to build the css afterwards.

For further customisation, copy the `theme/project-doc/layouts/` folder to the root of your website and start tweaking!
Hugo will automatically use the layout from the site directory over the one in the them directory.
For more information, please have a look at the [theme customisation documentation](https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/) on the Hugo website.
